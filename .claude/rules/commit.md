# Git Commit Rules

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Language Requirements

- All commit messages MUST be written in Japanese
- Messages should clearly and concisely describe the changes
- Do NOT include "Generated by Claude" or similar metadata in commit messages

### Code Quality Checks

- ALWAYS run `yarn fix` before committing
- Fix any linter errors before proceeding with commit
- Ensure the codebase passes all formatting and linting checks

### Message Content

- Review changes using `git status` and `git diff` before crafting the message
- Focus on the purpose and impact of changes, not just what was changed
- When multiple changes are present, focus on the primary change
- Keep messages concise but descriptive

## Commit Process

1. **Pre-commit checks**

- Run `npm run fix` to ensure code quality
- Verify no linting errors exist

2. **Review changes**

- Execute `git status` and `git diff` in parallel to understand all modifications
- Analyze the scope and impact of changes

3. **Create commit message**

- Write a concise Japanese message based on the changes
- Focus on WHY the change was made, not just WHAT was changed

4. **Stage and commit**

- Use `git add .` to stage all relevant files
- Execute `git commit` with the Japanese message

5. **Verify commit**

- Run `git status` to confirm successful commit
- Ensure working tree is clean
